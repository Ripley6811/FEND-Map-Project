This is a map showing places that I like to go to and my photography (with location data) from around where I live in Nanzhi, Taiwan. This web site uses the Google Maps, Flickr, and Foursquare APIs.  It also uses Bootstrap and Knockout.js for styling and showing a dynamic list of links.

Features:
- Clickable map markers that display an image and short description.
- Click on Flickr images to see a larger version on the Flickr web site.
- Lower right-hand search box and list that responds to browser resizing.
- Type "coffee" or other terms in the Foursquare search box to browse other locations in the current viewable area.
